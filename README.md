# CoroutinesExample_AsyncAwait

async and await is use to run task paralel. in this demo, if we not use async and await stock1 will take 10 second to complete and stock2 will take another 10 seconds, so to complete the task, it will need 20 seconds

but with async and await, we can run this task paralel, its mean, while stock 1 is running, stock2 is also will be running in paralel and instead of 20 seconds, we only take 10 seconds to complete all the task
